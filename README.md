# recommendation_system_with_tensorflow
Use the Tensorflow Recommenders library to make movie recommendations with the GroupLens database. The models have been simplified so that it is possible to run them on an ordinary CPU (your laptop should be able to run them in a reasonable time). It is therefore normal that the results obtained with these models are not as accurate as those obtained by optimizing this approach. However, this is a good starting point for anyone who has never touched a large-scale neural network infrastructure.
